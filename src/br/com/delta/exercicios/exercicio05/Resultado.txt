Respostas:

* A) c.doStuff();
* B) s.doStuff();
* C) this.doStuff();
* D) super.doStuff();

A, B, C, and D are correct. A, B, and C will invoke Cool’s version of doStuff(), and D will invoke SuperCool’s version of doStuff().

E, F, and G are all illegal syntax to try to invoke SuperCool’s version of doStuff().

H is incorrect because the rest of the code is legal.
